# Algroithms related to consistent hashing and the Chord DHT.

This package implements low-level fatures, such as:

* Node-ID Arithmetic as described in [Chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(peer-to-peer))
* A circular sorted associative Map called `Circle`.
* A holistic member ring that is capable to emulate the "finger table".
